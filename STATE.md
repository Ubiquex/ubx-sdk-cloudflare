## In flight

Nothing in flight -- this repo was just scaffolded.

## Blocked

Nothing blocked. Zero open PRs.

## Current state

No release cut yet -- this repo has not published to the Go module proxy,
npm, or PyPI. `NPM_TOKEN`/`PYPI_TOKEN` must be provisioned as real repo
secrets before the first `publish.yml` dispatch can succeed (see
`CLAUDE.md`'s own "Publishing discipline" section).

`VERSION` at repo root records the real upstream spec this generation was
fetched from.

## Before touching anything

- Never self-merge here. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- Never hand-edit generated bindings -- fix the generator or the upstream
  schema, then regenerate.
